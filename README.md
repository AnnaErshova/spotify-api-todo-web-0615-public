# Spotify's Chart API Todo

## Objective

Get more familiar with using APIs and parsing JSON in Ruby.

## Introduction

Scraping sites is one way to get data but many times, companies will expose more data through their application programming interfaces, or APIs. For this todo, we're going to focus on Spotify's chart API.

## Instructions
* This is a test-driven lab so just get those specs to pass!

## Extra Credit
* Make a commandline app that interacts with the API.
